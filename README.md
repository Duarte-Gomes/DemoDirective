I had use Directives before but know I understood most of the key features for future implementation.

I researched Stackoverflow and view this Udemy course https://www.udemy.com/angularjs-custom-directives/learn/v4/content to make this exercise.

Had some difficulty installing Angular and Bootstrap using NPM, so decided to use CDN instead.
